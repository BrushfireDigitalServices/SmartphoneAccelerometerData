# SmartphoneAccelerometerData
R script and code book for reading into R the human activity recognition smartphone accelerometer data obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository in a "tidy" data.frame.

### The original data, in the form of a directory structure within a .zip file, can be obtained at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Note that the terms of use for the original data set explicitly **prohibit** commercial use.

### A decription of the Human Activity Recognition experiment, license, and data collection methods can be found at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

More details are available from the file "README.txt" within the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

Users are expected to extract the dataset archive to the top level of their R working directory before running run_analysis.R. 

### As specified the source of the dataset, the proper citation for using the dataset this repo is designed to operate on is as follows:
